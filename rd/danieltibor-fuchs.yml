  ## Bio
  My main goal is my family and my work is the tool to empower them to achieve the future that we - the different communities that integrate humankind - are building together.
  I’m responsible for Strategy and Innovation in Datora Telecom and am always looking for the company's next step. I'm technology influencer and I become part of the customer team when selling to them, allowing me to guarantee the best solution for their needs, focused on the long-term relationship.
  I'm more of a generalist on many IT and Telecom Technologies than a specialist: I prefer to focus on the big picture and what pieces we need to succeed.
  I am a "thing" when I'm part of the IoT community.
  I am a Microsoft Regional Director when I'm part of the IT Community.
  I'm a connector when I'm part of the Global Community, not always looking for the short term.
  I'm a small gear inside of this complex engine called humankind.
  I'm your partner if you want to go to the next step.
